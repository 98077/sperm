Hi:

I read your job description from StackOverflow. I think that's exactly what I want to do and I'm totally qualified to it. 

My name is Yan Zhang, and I'm a Software Engineer from China with years experience of system software development on Linux and passionate about some low-level stuff. And I'm not sure whether my years experience of distributed systems design and implementation is a plus. 

I write blog a lot http://dirlt.com/ (although much stuff is in Chinese), and play dozens of open source projects which are written in my Linkedin. 

Looking forward to your reply.

Sincerely.
